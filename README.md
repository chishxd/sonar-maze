# The Sonar Maze

A maze game where you have to rely on sonar senses or you crash into depths of the sea.
Built with Rust for Siege Hackclub

<!-- TODO: Add a GIF -->

## How To Play
- `WASD` to move, `spacebar` to emit sonar
- The sonar would show you route for a moment
- Reach the exit before the fuel runs out!!
- If you crash the wall, well you might meet those billionares :D

PS: Nothing spooky in this game so dw

## So... where are grids??
Okay so, the game is 100% on a grid. But I thought it'd be more fun if the grid was **the actual enemy.**

It's totally invisible. Your only move is to 'ping' your sonar, which lights up the maze for a hot second.

The whole gameplay loop is just: **Ping. Memorize. Pray.**

It's less about moving on a grid and more about building one in your head. iykyk.
